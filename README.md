# CTF-Web-Hunt
This is a write-up for one of the TryHackMe challenge-TryHeartMe

# Objective:-
Through this CTF challenge, we need to find out the vulnerability of a web-page to get the final flag.

# Pre-Requisites:-
There is already given an attackbox in the room, you can use that or either connect the tryhackme vpn into your own virtual box environment.

# Task:-
There is a shop which is open for business and we have to find a way to purchase the hidden **Valenflag** item. They have already given the port through which we can access the webapp i.e. **5000**
